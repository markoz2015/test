					<p><span class="large-text">A</span>t the beginning of my career into computers I was introduced to a computer at a very early age 
					that I mostly played games on. Over time one of my family members introduced me to Qbasic and DOS 
					prompt extending my knowledge into the programming world creating the simplest programs "Hello World".</p>
					<p>I started using this language to create mini games using letter characters as objects that would react when 
					collided and make effects; this future fuelled my wanting to create more complex programs but it was not till 
					later I understood how to use arrays, for loops and cases effectively.</p>
					
					<p>After school I decided the IT path as this is a subject I know most about and I'm most comfortable with as I use a 
					computer on a daily basis; I took the BTEC First Diploma for IT Practitioners course provided by Bridgend college to 
					try out if computing was for me and it was. I breezed through the course and continued on to the next course BTEC National 
					Diploma for IT Practitioners and completed that giving me enough confidence and tools to head out and do IT freelance in 2009.</p>
					<p>At this present time I'm a well known freelance IT technician and website designer; Keeping up to date with the latest 
					technologies in the computing industry.</p>
					<p>Just recently I've just completed my BSc Information Systems course in the University of SouthWales and awaiting my results, 
					whilst looking for work.</p>
